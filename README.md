This is the link to my webpage and repo.

## Purpose

The purpose of this webpage is to generate a webpage that displays the current weather for a given city as well as a 5-day forecast as well as show the 10 most recent searches.

## My Experience

My experience creating this webpage was a bit challenging due to it being a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It taught me how to use API's as well as debug issues that would arise.
